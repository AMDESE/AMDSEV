Follow the below steps to build and run the SEV-SNP guest. The step below are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 host and guest.

## Build

The following command builds the host and guest Linux kernel, qemu and ovmf bios used for launching SEV-SNP guest.

````
# git clone https://github.com/AMDESE/AMDSEV.git
# git checkout sev-snp-devel
# ./build.sh --package
# sudo cp kvm.conf /etc/modprobe.d/
````
On succesful build, the binaries will be available in `snp-release-<DATE>`.

## Prepare Host

Verify that the following BIOS settings are enabled. The setting may vary based on the vendor BIOS. The menu option below are from AMD BIOS.
  
```
  CBS -> CPU Common ->
                SEV-ES ASID space Limit Control -> Manual
                SEV-ES ASID space limit -> 100
                SNP Memory Coverage -> Enabled 
                SMEE -> Enabled
      -> NBIO common ->
                SEV-SNP -> Enabled
```
  
Run the following command to install the Linux kernel on the host machine.

```
# cd snp-release-<date>
# ./install.sh
```

Reboot the machine and choose SNP Host kernel from the grub menu.

Run the following commands to verify that SNP is enabled in the host.

````
# uname -r
5.14.0-rc2-snp-host

# dmesg | grep -i -e rmp -e sev

*NOTE: If your SEV-SNP firmware is older than 1.51, see the "Upgrade SEV firmware" section to upgrade the firmware. *
  
## Prepare Guest

Boot up a guest (tested with Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, but any standard *.deb or *.rpm-based distro should work) and install the guest kernel packages built in the previous step. The guest kernel packages are available in 'snp-release-<DATE>/linux/guest' directory.

## Launch SNP Guest

To launch the SNP guest use the launch-qemu.sh script provided in this repository

````
# ./launch-qemu.sh -hda <your_qcow2_file> -sev-snp
````

To launch SNP disabled guest, simply remove the "-sev-snp" from the above command line.

Once the guest is booted, run the following command inside the guest VM to verify that SNP is enabled:

````
$ dmesg | grep -i snp
AMD Memory Encryption Features active: SEV SEV-ES SEV-SNP
````

## Upgrade SEV firmware

The SEV-SNP support requires firmware version >= 1.50:1. The latest SEV-SNP firmware is available on https://developer.amd.com/sev and eventually via linux-firmware project.

The below steps document the firmware upgrade process for the latest SEV-SNP firmware available on https://developer.amd.com/sev at the time this was written. A similar procedure can be used for newer firmwares as well:

```
# wget https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh_1.33.03.zip
# unzip amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh_1.33.03.zip
# sudo mkdir -p /lib/firmware/amd
# sudo cp amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh_1.33.03.sbin /lib/firmware/amd/amd_sev_fam19h_model0xh.sbin
```
Then either reboot the host, or reload the ccp driver to complete the firmware upgrade process:

```
sudo rmmod kvm_amd
sudo rmmod ccp
sudo modprobe ccp
sudo modprobe kvm_amd
```
